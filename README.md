# Simple Notes App

Simple Notes is a Flutter application that aims to be a very simplified version of a common note/task saving app.

## Features
### Notes
Create, edit, sort and delete simple notes that have a **title** and a **general text** where you can type anything you want to remember.
Notes can also be added to a **group** too if you have created any.

This notes can be long-pressed to select many notes at the same tame.

### Tasks
Create, edit, sort and delete tasks that have a **title** and a **checklist** where you can add as many **subtasks** as you need.
Every subtask has its checkbox to mark that subtask as completed and a little trash can button to delete that subtask easily.

This notes can also be long-pressed to display a quick access menu to **edit** or **delete** it.

### Groups
Create and edit groups so you can add your notes to them.
Having groups and adding notes to them make the notes have an **outline border** of the same color as that note's group and will let you filter notes by it's group.

To do this you only have to create a group inside the **groups** section of the **Menu** located in the top-left corner of the app, add notes to them and tap on the group you want to filter.

### Recicle bin
Deleted notes and tasks will be sent to the **recicle bin** so you can recover them if you delete any note or task by accident.

Notes and Tasks inside the recicle bin can be sorted by its **delete date** to help you find notes or tasks easily.

**IMPORTANT:** Notes and Tasks inside the recicle bin can't be edited and will be deleted automatically in 30 days.
